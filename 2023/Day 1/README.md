# Notes

## Part 1

## Part 2

Part 1 was fairly easy but 2 kicked my butt. After reviewing some comments on Hacker News I realized I wasn't accounting for all cases such as `oneight`. I wasted some time assuming that the `Select-String -AllMatches` parameter was covering that situation. To find the true last number I decided to reverse the string since using regex to find the last value was a little more difficult. Somehow even that still isn't working ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è so I'm skipping this one for now.
