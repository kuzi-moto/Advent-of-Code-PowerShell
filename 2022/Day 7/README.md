# Notes

## Part 1

Made a couple of mistakes here that made solving this way longer thn it should have. First one was forgetting to implement `cd ..`, the second was counting all the subdirectories at every single layer. Oh well, this was still pretty fun.

## Part 2

The array of directory sizes from P1 came in handy here. Sorted the array by size and grabbed the first one that met the space required.
