# Notes

## Part 1

This marks the furthest day I've made it to in the AoC challenges! I'd guess there was a better way of solving this, but I created a two-dimensional array then determined the number of visible trees going from each of the four directions.

## Part 2

Similar to P1, but now we need to go each direction for each tree from the input. I was surprised to find that this executed faster than P1 by more than a full second!
