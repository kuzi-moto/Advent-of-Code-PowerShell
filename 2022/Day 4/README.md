# Notes

## Part 1

Compare-Object again to the rescue. Initially I forgot to account for sets that are exactly equal to each other so that led me to spend a lot of time looking for a bug in my array code.

## Part 2

This part only required a small adjustment to Compare-Object to show equal ID's, then count each occurrence.
