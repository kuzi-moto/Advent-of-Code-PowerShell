# Notes

## Part 1

This one took almost 5 seconds to run which leads me to believe there was a more efficient way to execute this, but overall happy with the result.

## Part 2

This one took way longer than it should have to solve. Couldn't figure out why I couldn't get the same result for the test input, so I wrote a function to display the tail output which took longer to do than solving the actual puzzle. In part 1 I didn't account for the head knot moving diagonally. Needed to add the instructions for when the previous knot had an X and Y difference of 2.
