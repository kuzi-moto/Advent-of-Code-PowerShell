# Notes

## Part 1

This part was fun. Initially I was going to use a bunch of convoluted if statements, but eventually realized that instead I could map rock/paper/scissors to their value and then subtract my choice with the opponent. The sums would determine if it was a win/loss/tie.

## Part 2

Similar strategy to part 1, just had to work backwards from the outcome to get the desired move. Created a lookup table to get the correct value.
